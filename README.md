| `lint`     | Runs `ESlint` on all files from `./src` and `./tests` |
| `lint:fix` | Runs `ESlint` and fixes all the inconsistencies       |
| `test`     | Runs the tests with Mocha                             |
| `test:dev` | Re-runs the tests whenever a change occurs            |
| `build`    | Compiles all ES2015 files to ES5 (legacy code)        |
| `clean`    | Removes the compiled files                            |

**NOTE:** There is another script `prepublish` that runs before you publish the package to NPM. All it does is to run `clean` and `build`.
